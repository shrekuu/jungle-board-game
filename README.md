# Jungle Game

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game) In this link, it describes the game called Jungle. I want to build a web app to allow 2 users to play side by side on the same page.


## Game rules

- Each player has 8 animals: 1 elephant, 1 lion, 1 tiger, 1 leopard, 1 wolf, 1 dog, 1 cat, 1 rat.
- The game board is divided into 7 columns and 9 rows. Each cell can only hold one animal.
- The animals can only move horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
- Each animal has a different rank. The rat is the lowest rank, and the elephant is the highest rank.
